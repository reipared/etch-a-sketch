## Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple web application called "Etch-a-Sketch" that allows users to draw on a sketchpad using their mouse. The application provides a grid of square div elements that change color when hovered over. Users can also clear the grid with a click of a button.

You can access the live demo of the application [here](https://etch-a-sketch.reipared.com/).

### Files

The application consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The HTML file that defines the structure of the web page. It includes meta tags, title, font imports, icon, stylesheet reference, and JavaScript script reference. It contains a container with a heading, controls section with a clear button, and a sketchpad section.

- **style.css**: The CSS file that contains the styles for the web page. It defines the styles for the container, heading, controls section, clear button, sketchpad, and individual squares within the sketchpad.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the web page. It contains functions to create the grid, change the color of the grid square on hover, and clear the grid. Event listeners are set to trigger these functions.

### Usage

To use the "Etch-a-Sketch" application, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. A grid of square div elements will be displayed on the page.
3. Move your mouse over the squares to draw on the sketchpad. The color of the squares will change to black.
4. Click the "Clear Grid" button to reset the sketchpad and clear all the drawn elements.

### Customization

You can customize the application by modifying the following files:

- **style.css**: Modify the styles in this file to change the appearance of the sketchpad, container, heading, buttons, and other elements.

- **script.js**: Customize the JavaScript code to change the behavior of the application. You can modify the grid size, color, or add additional functionality.

Feel free to experiment and make changes to create your own version of the "Etch-a-Sketch" application.
